# Neutral Academia

A minimalist and elegant theme fitting dark and light academia aesthetic. 

Used fonts: Cormorant Semibold for headings and other elements, Inter for folders, Manrope for note text.

Note: The screenshots are slightly outdated because I did some small edits to this theme. Colors and fonts are still the same.
